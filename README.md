Computational code to accompany the submission "Boie S, Chen J, Sanderson MJ, and Sneyd J. *The relative contributions of store-operated and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to the control Ca2+ oscillations in airway smooth muscle*."

This repository includes all computational code that is needed to obtain the results in the submitted manuscript.

The folders starting with Auto* rely on a working installation of the numerical continuation package AUTO (which can be downloaded from http://indy.cs.concordia.ca/auto/) and python 2. The continuation can be run by running the files 'runAuto.py'.

The other script and function files can be directly executed in MATLAB (http://www.mathworks.com).
